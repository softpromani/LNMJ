                    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size:13px;">The University department of Physics was started in an old shanty of a building that housed the physics department of C. M. Science College, Darbhanga in the year 1972, with Prof. C. K. Rama Verma, Ph.D (LONDON) as its head. Prof. Verma was looking after the department in addition to his duties as the Head, Department of Physics, C. M. Science College, Darbhanga.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size:13px;">He was ably assisted by his colleagues in the department in running both the departments. The
fortune of the department took a turn for the better when Dr. Dhirendra Kumar Jha, Ph. D(London) was appointed full time Head to run the post graduate department with Dr. Gopi Kant Jha(now deceased) and Dr. Lalan Jha to assist him. This was when the post graduate teaching was shifted to Moti Mahal campus in the Nargauna Complex. All of them were quite young then and took up challenge of building the department brick by brick. Soon they were joined by new and fresh M.Sc pass out colleagues. The inclusion of fresh blood combined youth with experience and under the stewardship of Dr. D. K. Jha, who served as a beacon light, the ship of Physics department sailed through the turbulent water unhindered and unobstructed even while some other department had hiccups and obstruction. The alumni of the department have distinguished themselves in different walks of life. In the field of research and development, the department has earned several research projects form funding agencies like DST, UGC, CSIR and the European Community besides providing Ph.D Degrees to scores of students.</p>
